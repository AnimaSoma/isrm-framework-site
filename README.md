🧠 What is ISRM?
ISRM proposes that all adaptive systems — from single cells to minds, from particles to markets — operate through a loop of prediction, comparison, and energetic arbitration between:

Observer System (OS) — a simplified model of reality
Physical System (PS) — the raw, high-dimensional environment
These interactions are governed by a scalar update function:

```math
U(t) = (\alpha M(t) + \beta \sigma^2(t)) \cdot (E_{max} - \gamma \int_0^t U(\tau)d\tau + I(t)) \cdot \delta |S_{PS}(t) - S_{OS}(t)|
